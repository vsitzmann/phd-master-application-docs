### Application materials for universities in the US
Hi - I'm [Vincent](vsitzmann.github.io). I'm from Germany originally, but came to the United States for a Master in Computer Science at Stanford University. I financed my stay there with a Fulbright scholarship. Subsequently, I went on to do my PhD at Stanford as well (and I'm still in the US :) ).

Here, I'm publishing my SoPs for my Fulbright scholarship, my MSc, and my PhD, such that they may serve as a resource for folks in similar situations.

I don't mean to imply that my documents are particularly well written, and I certainly do **not** recommend that you copy their structure or their content 1:1 - your application likely needs to look different. However, maybe you might be able to take away some principles or some ideas that are useful also in your writing of your application documents. Good luck!

My friend Ludwig Schubert has also shared [his SoP for his Master Application at Stanford!](https://github.com/ludwigschubert/master-application-stanford)
